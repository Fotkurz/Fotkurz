- 👋 Hey, my name is Guilherme, I usually use the @fotkurz nickname mostly because I use it since I was 12 (I did read in some random website, that I could translate my name to black speech to Fotkurz, I know, it means something like little foot in german I think). 
- 👀 I’m interested in technology and science mostly. I really do appreciate all the open source codes around. I'm still learning how to contribute to those projects here on git.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java with Spring Framework. I'm also studying some C++ and how to make drivers, really appreciate how we can use our code to comunicate with different types of hardware.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Scientific projects that may help improving the access of people to advance our lives.
- 📫
